//# Java Project - Snap
//
//---
//
//        ## Overview
//
//Your task is to model a card game using the Java language. We’ve broken this challenge down
//into small parts, with the expectation that some of you will keep things simple and master the
//basics, while some of you will push on into the stratosphere!
//
//        **Good Luck!**
//
//        ---
//
//        ## Stage 1
//
//        Using classes, ArrayLists and methods, create a deck of Cards. You should use the following
//classes:
//
//        ### CardGame
//
//- Contains an ArrayList\<Card\> for the deckOfCards that contains all 52 cards. This is created and populated when the game is constructed.
//        - Has a name which is also defined in the constructor.
//        - Has a getDeck method that lists out the cards in the deck.
//
//        ### Card
//
//- Has a String suit. Use the unicode characters of heart, club, diamond and spade.
//        - Has a String symbol (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A)
//- Has an int value (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14)
//- Has a toString method that describes the class
//
//---
//
//        ## Stage 2
//
//Lets get some core functionality to our CardGame by implementing the following methods:
//
//        **Card dealCard()**
//
//Takes the card from the top of the deck and returns it.
//
//        **ArrayList\<Card\> sortDeckInNumberOrder()**
//
//Sorts the deck in number order (e.g. 2222333344445555 etc) and stores the new shuffled deck back into the deckOfCards attribute.
//
//**ArrayList\<Card\> sortDeckIntoSuits()**
//
//Sorts the deck into suits (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A of hearts, then 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A of clubs etc.) and stores the new shuffled deck back into the deckOfCards attribute.
//
//**ArrayList\<Card\> shuffleDeck()**
//
//Shuffles the deck into a random order and stores the new shuffled deck back into the deckOfCards attribute.
//
//---
//
//        ### Stage 3
//
//Create class for Snap that extends CardGame.
//
//        This class should use the methods defined
//        above, as well as some new ones, to enable the user to play the game snap according to the
//following rules:
//
//        - By pressing enter in the command line, the user takes their turn.
//- Each turn, a new card is dealt from the deck.
//        - The game continues until two cards in a row have the same symbol, at which point the “player” wins and the game ends.
//
//### Stage 4
//
//Create a Player class and enable the snap game to be two player, with the users taking it in turns to go. If the snap occurs on the users turn, they win.
//
//Add a timer so that when there is a snap opportunity, the player has 2 seconds to submit the word “snap” in order to win. If they don’t type it in time, they lose.
//
