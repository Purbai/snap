//Create a Player class and enable the snap game to be two player, with the users taking it in turns to go. If the snap occurs on the users turn, they win.

//Add a timer so that when there is a snap opportunity, the player has 2 seconds to submit the word “snap” in order to win. If they don’t type it in time, they lose.
